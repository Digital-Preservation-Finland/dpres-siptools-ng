Examples
========

The following examples demonstrate how siptools-ng can be used.

.. note::

   These scripts are standalone and can be run as-is.
   You can do so by opening the directory `doc/source/examples`
   in project root.

Simple
------

This example is the minimal example that only contains the default structural
map and technical metadata. The :meth:`siptools_ng.sip.SIP.from_directory`
factory method is used generate a SIP from a directory in the local filesystem.
This also means that aside from the METS object creation and importing
descriptive metadata, there is no need to use the underlying
dpres-mets-builder_ library.

  :language: Python

Advanced
--------

This example is more involved.
In addition to the automatic structural map generated by siptools-ng, it
details how additional metadata can be imported and a structural map created by
hand. This involves the use of the underlying dpres-mets-builder_ library.

The example uses the :meth:`siptools_ng.sip.SIP.from_files` factory method
which allows generating a SIP with a directory structure different from how
the files are stored on disk.
